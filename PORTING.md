# Porting queue between the Android app and the web version

When a session adds or changes a reader feature on one platform, it adds a line here under the other
platform ("to do on web" / "to do on Android"): what changed, the commit, the file. The session working on
the other platform checks this file at the start, ports the change, and moves the line to "Done" with its commit.
Platform-specific things (APK updates, iPad gestures) are not listed.

## To do on web

(the web version starts from `web/PLAN.md`, which already covers Android v1.23)

(nothing)

## To do on Android


## Done

- Android: Gemini 503/429 retries 2/4/8 s + fallback flash model; chat "Повторить" (`Gemini.kt`, `Chat.kt`).

- web aa8d97f: Text view is paged, not one long scroll: pages fit the screen, swipe left/right turns them; a paragraph
  that does not fit is split at a sentence boundary; pages are rebuilt when pins/translations/font change
  and the page being read is kept; page counter "3 / 12" under the progress bar. Sentence mode collapses
  slowly (~0.5 s). Android commit 53b0f28, `Reader.kt` (`PagedText`, `TextPager`).
  Note: on Android, rendering the whole lesson off-screen to measure it ran out of memory on long lessons;
  heights are now computed from text sizes (`TextMetrics`, commit 87bc83d). On the web, render only the
  current page (+ neighbours) too.
  Web: only the current page and its neighbours are shown; measuring caches paragraph heights by what changes
  them and renders new ones in batches of 25, so a pin re-measures one paragraph, not the lesson (see next commit).
- web aa8d97f: Gemini chat answers are Markdown: render bold/italic/headings/lists/quotes/code (Android `Markdown.kt`,
  commit df2779e). On the web a small Markdown renderer (e.g. `marked` + sanitizing) is fine.
- web cd68734: Gemini limit/overload (HTTP 429/503, RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED, quota) after retries+fallback: a window
  "Gemini: лимит исчерпан" with "Попробовать другую модель" -> model list -> the choice becomes the current
  model and the failed request is repeated (word pin, word window, sentence translation, retranslate, chat).
  Android `ModelSwitch.kt`, `AppState.geminiFailed`.

- web cd68734: Several words at once: long press on a word, keep the finger down and drag over other words of the same
  sentence (selection highlighted); release -> window with the phrase translated together in context
  (Gemini word prompt + "this is a phrase" note; LingQ: hints + machine translation), chips to choose,
  own variant (saved per lesson like word meanings). Long press without dragging = sentence translation as
  before. Android `Reader.kt` (`wordGestures`, `openPhrase`, `PhraseSheet`).
